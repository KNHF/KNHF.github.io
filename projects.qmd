These are some of the projects I’m working on or have built recently. I prefer to show real things—even if they’re
still evolving—rather than pretend everything is perfectly finished. Each project teaches me something new about
structure, tooling, and how to make ideas actually run.

  <h2>Python File Organizer</h2>
  <p>
    A practical automation tool that cleans and structures messy folders. It moves files into organised directories
    based on type and rules, making it easier to keep a machine tidy over time. The focus is on clarity and
    predictable behaviour.

  <h2>This Portfolio</h2>
  <p>
    A Quarto-based personal site where I document my work and experiments. I treat the site itself as a project:
    structure, styling, and content are all things I iterate on, just like code.

  <h2>Finance / Quant Experiments</h2>

    test ideas, and build intuition without overcomplicating things.
