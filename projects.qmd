These are some of the projects I’m working on or have built recently. I prefer to show real things—even if they’re
still evolving—rather than pretend everything is perfectly finished. Each project teaches me something new about
structure, tooling, and how to make ideas actually run.

  <h2>Python File Organizer</h2>
  <p>
    A practical automation tool that cleans and structures messy folders. It moves files into organised directories
    based on type and rules, making it easier to keep a machine tidy over time. The focus is on clarity: simple
    prompts, clear behaviour, and a layout that someone else can understand.

  <h2>This Portfolio Site</h2>
  <p>
    A Quarto-based personal site where I document my work, experiments, and projects. I’m using it as a place to
    practice clean structure, styling, and communication—treating the site itself as a project, not just a static
    page. Everything from the layout to the CSS is something I’m iterating on.

  <h2>Finance / Quant Experiments</h2>
  <p>
    A set of small experiments with financial data, signals, and simple models. The goal isn’t to build a trading
    system overnight, but to understand how data behaves, what features matter, and how to test ideas in a structured
    way without overcomplicating things.
