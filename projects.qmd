This page collects the projects I'm working on or planning. Some are small but useful tools, others are ideas that
I’m still shaping into something concrete. I prefer to be honest about what’s “in progress” rather than pretending
everything is finished and polished.

  <h2>Python File Organizer</h2>
  <p>
    A small automation tool I built to clean messy folders and make file management easier. It groups files into
    structured directories so things are easier to find and maintain. The goal is to keep it simple enough that
    anyone can run it without needing to understand every line of code.

  <h2>Finance / Quant Exploration (In Progress)</h2>
  <p>
    An ongoing exploration into financial data, signals, and simple modelling approaches. I'm interested in how
    far you can get with clean data, sensible features, and transparent models before jumping into overly complex
    architectures. This project is about learning, testing ideas, and building intuition.

    <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, Pandas, basic ML  
    <br>
    <strong>Status:</strong> Early experimentation

  <h2>Medical AI Ideas (Planning)</h2>
  <p>
    I'm exploring how AI can be applied to medical imaging, especially in areas like dental or radiology data.
    This is still in the planning stage, but I'm interested in problems where models can assist professionals
    rather than replace them—things like triage, prioritisation, or simple classification tasks.

    <strong>Tech:</strong> Python, PyTorch (planned), image processing  
    <br>
    <strong>Status:</strong> Concept and research
