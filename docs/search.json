    "text": "I’m Karan, a Data Science master’s student at UWE Bristol. I focus on building systems that are efficient, structured, and genuinely useful. Most of my projects start with a simple question: “How can this be done better?”\n\n\nI work with Python, R, SQL, and tools like Docker, Git, and Quarto to create clean, reproducible workflows. I enjoy taking something messy — files, data, or a vague idea — and turning it into a process that’s predictable and easy to maintain.\n\n\nI’m currently developing my skills toward the finance and quantitative space. I’m interested in how data behaves in real markets, how signals form, and how to test ideas without overfitting or overcomplicating things. My goal is to build a strong foundation in practical analytics and eventually move into roles where data, modelling, and decision‑making intersect.\n\n\nOutside of work, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly refining my own setups — whether that’s my workflow, my tools, or how I organise information.\n\n\nTools I use\n\n\n\nPython\n\n\nR & RStudio\n\n\nSQL & MySQL\n\n\nDocker\n\n\nGit & GitHub\n\n\nQuarto\n\n\nPandas\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\n\n\nHome About Projects Contact\n\n\n \n\n\n© Karan Homayounfar — Built with Quarto."
