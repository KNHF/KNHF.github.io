    "text": "I’m Karan, a Data Science master’s student based in Bristol. I like building things that are practical, structured, and actually useful. Whether it’s a small automation script or a full project with documentation and a clean workflow, I care about clarity and making sure the end result feels intentional rather than thrown together.\n\n\nMost of my work revolves around Python, R, SQL, and tools like Git, Docker, and Quarto. I enjoy taking something messy — files, data, or a vague idea — and turning it into something organised, predictable, and easy to understand. I’m not trying to overcomplicate things; I prefer solutions that are simple, reliable, and easy for someone else to pick up.\n\n\nHow I approach projects\n\n\nI like to work in a step-by-step, structured way:\n\n\n\nStart with a clear, honest description of the problem.\n\n\nBreak it into small, testable pieces instead of one big jump.\n\n\nKeep the folder structure and code layout clean from the start.\n\n\nDocument decisions so future me (or someone else) can follow the logic.\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to pretend everything is perfect or finished. I’d rather show real work in progress, explain what I’ve learned, and keep improving it over time.\n\n\nTools I use\n\n\n\nPython\n\n\nR & RStudio\n\n\nSQL & MySQL\n\n\nDocker\n\n\nGit & GitHub\n\n\nQuarto\n\n\nPandas & Data Analysis\n\n\nMachine Learning\n\n\n\nOutside of code\n\n\nOutside of studying and building projects, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly refining my own setups—whether that’s my home tech, my workflows, or how I organise information. I like finding small improvements that make everyday things smoother.\n\n\nConnect with me\n\n\n\nGitHub: github.com/knhf\n\n\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/karen-homayounfar-96824893\n\n\n\n© Karan Homayounfar — Built with Quarto.\n\n\n\n\n&lt;a href=\"index.html\"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"about.html\"&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"projects.html\"&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"contact.html\"&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&lt;a href=\"https://github.com/knhf\" aria-label=\"GitHub\"&gt;\n  &lt;i class=\"bi bi-github\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/karen-homayounfar-96824893/\" aria-label=\"LinkedIn\"&gt;\n  &lt;i class=\"bi bi-linkedin\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n© Karan Homayounfar — Built with Quarto."
