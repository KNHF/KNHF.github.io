Each project teaches me something new about structure, tooling, and how to make ideas actually run.\n\n\n\n\nPython File Organizer\n\n\nA practical automation tool that cleans and structures messy folders. It moves files into organised directories based on type and rules, making it easier to keep a machine tidy over time. The focus is on clarity: simple prompts, clear behaviour, and a layout that someone else can understand.\n\n\nTech: Python\n Repo: github.com/knhf/file-organizer\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Portfolio Site\n\n\nA Quarto-based personal site where I document my work, experiments, and projects. I’m using it as a place to practice clean structure, styling, and communication—treating the site itself as a project, not just a static page. Everything from the layout to the CSS is something I’m iterating on.\n\n\nTech: Quarto, HTML, CSS, GitHub Pages\n Repo: github.com/knhf/KNHF.github.io\n\n\n\n\n\nFinance / Quant Experiments\n\n\nA set of small experiments with financial data, signals, and simple models. The goal isn’t to build a trading system overnight, but to understand how data behaves, what features matter, and how to test ideas in a structured way without overcomplicating things.\n\n\nTech: Python, Pandas, basic ML\n Status: Ongoing exploration"

    "text": "I’m Karan, a Data Science master’s student based in Bristol. I like building things that are practical, clear, and actually usable—whether that’s a small automation script or a full project with structure, documentation, and a clean workflow behind it. I care a lot about how a project feels to use, not just how it looks in the code editor.\n\n\nMost of my work so far has been in Python, R, and SQL, with a focus on data analysis, automation, and turning ideas into working tools. I enjoy taking something messy—files, data, or a vague problem—and turning it into something organised and predictable. I’m also comfortable working with Git, Docker, and Quarto to keep things reproducible and shareable.\n\n\nHow I work\n\n\nI like to approach projects step by step:\n\n\n\nStart with a clear, honest description of the problem.\n\n\nBreak it into small, testable pieces instead of one big jump.\n\n\nKeep the folder structure and code layout clean from the start.\n\n\nDocument decisions so future me (or someone else) can follow the logic.\n\n\n\nI’m not trying to pretend everything is perfect or finished. I’d rather show real work in progress, explain what I’ve learned, and keep improving it over time.\n\n\nTools I use\n\n\n\nPython – data analysis, automation, small tools and scripts.\n\n\nR & RStudio – statistical work, exploratory analysis, and reporting.\n\n\nSQL & MySQL – working with structured data and databases.\n\n\nDocker – making environments reproducible and easier to run.\n\n\nGit & GitHub – version control and sharing projects.\n\n\nQuarto – building this portfolio and technical documents.\n\n\n\nOutside of code\n\n\nOutside of studying and building projects, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly tweaking my own setups—whether that’s my home tech, my workflows, or how I organise information. I like finding small improvements that make everyday things smoother.\n\n\nConnect with me\n\n\n\nGitHub: github.com/knhf\n\n\nLinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/karen-homayounfar-96824893"

    "text": "Hi, I’m Karan\n\n\nData Science master’s student in Bristol, building practical, real-world projects in analytics, automation, and AI.\n\n\n\nI’m currently studying Data Science at UWE Bristol and focusing on turning ideas into working, useful tools.\nI like taking messy, unstructured problems and breaking them down into something clean, logical, and repeatable. A lot of what I build starts from a simple question: “Can I make this easier or smarter?”\n\n\nRight now I’m exploring a mix of automation, data analysis, and applied machine learning. I’m especially interested in domains where small, well-designed tools can have a big impact—things like finance, medical imaging, and workflow optimisation. I care about structure, clarity, and making things that other people can actually use.\n\n\nSkills\n\n\n\nPython\n\n\nPandas & Data Analysis\n\n\nMachine Learning (scikit-learn)\n\n\nAutomation Scripts & Tools\n\n\nSQL & Databases\n\n\nDocumentation & Clean Structure\n\n\n\nWhat I’m working on\n\n\n\nPython File Organizer – a small but useful tool to clean and structure messy folders.\n\n\nFinance / Quant exploration – experimenting with signals, features, and simple models.\n\n\nMedical AI ideas – looking into how imaging data can be used in practical ways.\n\n\n\nI’m still early in my journey, but I’m building things step by step and trying to keep everything as clear, reproducible, and honest as possible.
