# Hi, I'm Karan

I'm a Data Science master's student at UWE Bristol, focused on building real-world, high‑impact AI and analytics projects.

I enjoy turning messy problems into clean, actionable solutions — whether it's automation, modelling, or workflow optimisation.

## What I'm working on
- A Python file organizer tool  
- A finance/quant modelling project  
- A medical imaging AI project
