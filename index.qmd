    <p class="hero-text">
      I like taking messy, unstructured problems and turning them into something clear, organised, and repeatable.
      Most of what I build starts from a simple question: <em>“Can I make this easier or smarter?”</em> I care about
      structure, clean workflows, and tools that someone else can actually use.

    <h3>Python File Organizer</h3>
    <p>
      A practical automation tool that cleans and structures messy folders. It moves files into organised directories
      based on type and rules, making it easier to keep a machine tidy over time. The focus is on clarity and
      predictable behaviour.

    <h3>This Portfolio</h3>
    <p>
      A Quarto-based personal site where I document my work and experiments. I treat the site itself as a project:
      structure, styling, and content are all things I iterate on, just like code.

    <h3>Finance / Quant Experiments</h3>
    <p>
      A set of small experiments with financial data, signals, and simple models. The goal is to understand behaviour,
      test ideas, and build intuition without overcomplicating things.

<h2 class="section-title">What I'm doing now</h2>

<p>
Right now I'm focusing on building a small set of solid, well-structured projects rather than chasing dozens of half-finished
ideas. I’m refining this portfolio, improving my automation tools, and exploring data in areas like finance and practical
analytics. As I go, I’m trying to keep everything reproducible, documented, and honest about where it is in its lifecycle.
