  <h1 class="hero-title">Hi, I'm Karan</h1>
  <p class="hero-subtitle">
    Data Science master's student in Bristol, building practical, real-world projects in analytics, automation, and AI.

<p>
I'm currently studying Data Science at UWE Bristol and focusing on turning ideas into working, useful tools.  
I like taking messy, unstructured problems and breaking them down into something clean, logical, and repeatable.
A lot of what I build starts from a simple question: <em>“Can I make this easier or smarter?”</em>
</p>

<p>
Right now I'm exploring a mix of automation, data analysis, and applied machine learning. I'm especially interested in
domains where small, well-designed tools can have a big impact—things like finance, medical imaging, and workflow
optimisation. I care about structure, clarity, and making things that other people can actually use.

<h2 class="section-title">What I'm working on</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python File Organizer</strong> – a small but useful tool to clean and structure messy folders.</li>
  <li><strong>Finance / Quant exploration</strong> – experimenting with signals, features, and simple models.</li>
  <li><strong>Medical AI ideas</strong> – looking into how imaging data can be used in practical ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I'm still early in my journey, but I'm building things step by step and trying to keep everything as clear,
reproducible, and honest as possible. This site will grow as I add more projects and refine the ones I already have.
