<div class="page-wrapper">

<p>
I'm Karan, a Data Science master's student based in Bristol. I like building things that are practical, structured, and
actually useful. Whether it's a small automation script or a full project with documentation and a clean workflow, I
care about clarity and making sure the end result feels intentional rather than thrown together.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work revolves around Python, R, SQL, and tools like Git, Docker, and Quarto. I enjoy taking something messy
— files, data, or a vague idea — and turning it into something organised, predictable, and easy to understand. I’m not
trying to overcomplicate things; I prefer solutions that are simple, reliable, and easy for someone else to pick up.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">How I approach projects</h2>

<p>
I like to work in a step-by-step, structured way:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a clear, honest description of the problem.</li>
  <li>Break it into small, testable pieces instead of one big jump.</li>
  <li>Keep the folder structure and code layout clean from the start.</li>
  <li>Document decisions so future me (or someone else) can follow the logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’m not trying to pretend everything is perfect or finished. I’d rather show real work in progress, explain what I’ve
learned, and keep improving it over time.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Outside of code</h2>

<p>
Outside of studying and building projects, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly refining my own
setups—whether that’s my home tech, my workflows, or how I organise information. I like finding small improvements
that make everyday things smoother.
