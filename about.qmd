# About Me

I'm Karan, a Data Science master's student based in Bristol.  
I enjoy building tools that make life easier — from automation scripts to clean data workflows.

## Interests
- High‑impact AI domains (finance, medical imaging, automation)
- Clean code and reproducible project structures
- Making technical tools accessible to non‑technical users

## Outside of work
I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and optimising my home tech setup.I'm always open to connecting with like‑minded people, so feel free to reach out!
