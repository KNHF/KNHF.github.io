<div class="page-wrapper">

<p>
I'm Karan, a Data Science master's student based in Bristol. I like building things that are both practical and
understandable—tools that someone else could pick up, read, and actually use without needing to dig through chaos.
A lot of my work revolves around structure: clean folders, clear code, and projects that feel intentional rather than
thrown together.
</p>

<p>
I’m particularly drawn to areas where data science and AI can have a direct, visible impact. Finance, medical imaging,
and automation all appeal to me because they combine real-world stakes with interesting technical challenges. I'm not
just chasing complexity for its own sake; I'm more interested in solutions that are robust, explainable, and grounded
in reality.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">How I like to work</h2>

<p>
I tend to approach projects in a very step-by-step way. I like to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a clear question or problem.</li>
  <li>Break it down into small, testable pieces.</li>
  <li>Keep the structure clean—both in code and in folders.</li>
  <li>Document what I’m doing so future me (or someone else) can follow it.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I care a lot about the experience of using a tool, not just building it. That means thinking about prompts, error
messages, and how someone who isn’t deeply technical might interact with what I’ve made.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Outside of data</h2>

<p>
Outside of studying and building projects, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly tweaking my own
setups—whether that’s my home tech, my workflows, or how I organise information. I like finding small optimisations
that make everyday things smoother.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Where this is going</h2>

<p>
Long term, I want to work in a space where I can combine solid technical work with real-world impact and good
communication. I’m interested in roles where I can own projects end-to-end: understanding the problem, designing the
solution, building it, and explaining it clearly to others.
