<div class="page-wrapper">

<p>
I'm Karan, a Data Science master's student based in Bristol. I like building things that are practical, clear, and
actually usable—whether that's a small automation script or a full project with structure, documentation, and a
clean workflow behind it. I care a lot about how a project feels to use, not just how it looks in the code editor.
</p>

<p>
Most of my work so far has been in Python, R, and SQL, with a focus on data analysis, automation, and turning ideas
into working tools. I enjoy taking something messy—files, data, or a vague problem—and turning it into something
organised and predictable. I’m also comfortable working with Git, Docker, and Quarto to keep things reproducible and
shareable.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">How I work</h2>

<p>
I like to approach projects step by step:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start with a clear, honest description of the problem.</li>
  <li>Break it into small, testable pieces instead of one big jump.</li>
  <li>Keep the folder structure and code layout clean from the start.</li>
  <li>Document decisions so future me (or someone else) can follow the logic.</li>
</ul>

<p>
I’m not trying to pretend everything is perfect or finished. I’d rather show real work in progress, explain what I’ve
learned, and keep improving it over time.
</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Tools I use</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Python</strong> – data analysis, automation, small tools and scripts.</li>
  <li><strong>R & RStudio</strong> – statistical work, exploratory analysis, and reporting.</li>
  <li><strong>SQL & MySQL</strong> – working with structured data and databases.</li>
  <li><strong>Docker</strong> – making environments reproducible and easier to run.</li>
  <li><strong>Git & GitHub</strong> – version control and sharing projects.</li>
  <li><strong>Quarto</strong> – building this portfolio and technical documents.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="section-title">Outside of code</h2>

<p>
Outside of studying and building projects, I enjoy volleyball, exploring Bristol, and constantly tweaking my own
setups—whether that’s my home tech, my workflows, or how I organise information. I like finding small improvements
that make everyday things smoother.
