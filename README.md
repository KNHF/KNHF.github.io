This repo contains the source for my personal portfolio site.  
I built it with **Quarto** because I wanted something clean, lightweight, and easy to maintain, while still giving me full control over the layout and styling.

The site includes my projects, a bit about me, and ways to get in touch.  
It’s intentionally simple — fast to load, easy to navigate, and focused on the content.

## What’s inside

The site is made up of a few Quarto pages:

- `index.qmd` — the homepage  
- `about.qmd` — who I am and what I do  
- `projects.qmd` — a selection of my work  
- `contact.qmd` — how to reach me  

Styling is handled through `styles.css`, and Quarto handles the build process automatically.

Everything gets rendered into the `docs/` folder, which GitHub Pages uses to publish the site.

## Tech I used

- **Quarto** for generating the site  
- **Markdown / QMD** for content  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting  

No JavaScript or frameworks — just a clean static site.

## Working on it locally

If you want to run the site yourself:

1. Install Quarto: https://quarto.org  
2. In the project folder, run:

```
quarto preview
```

This starts a local server and updates automatically when you edit files.

To build the site manually:

```
quarto render
```

The output goes into the `docs/` folder.
